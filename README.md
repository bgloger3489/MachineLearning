# MachineLearning

This was a project I worked on in my senior year of highschool to better understand how machine learning works.
I figured that the best way to understand something, is to take it apart and put it back togehter again.
I decided to do it in Java. (At the time it was the language I knew best and its Object Oriented Style meant that my code had to be well structured / organized)

Things to Note: 
  1. I began my project, doing a simple line-of-best-fit regression on a scatter plot (ax+b and ax^2+bx+c) using X-Charts to animate it. I then expanded this into matrix math.
  2. I wanted the design to be dynamic: by putting together the different 'nodes' any kind of regressable-model can be created.
  3. In the end I trained a fully connected Nueral Network on CIFAR-10, and got some pretty interesting results:
    My model was 20% accurate. Yeah, nothing revolutionary, BUT BETTER THAN RANDOM!!!!!
    A visualization of the different classifications is attached
    
Overall, it was a really fun and rewarding experience. More than just a computer science project, I learned about matrix math and multivariable calculus, but also gained really valuable skills in self-education.
